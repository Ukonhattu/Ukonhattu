## I have been expecting you
I knew you would come here. Welcome traveller, to my little profile.
I am a software wizard, a maker of all things code. Been learning since 2011, so I have picked up a few tricks on the way.
I have also been a mentor, a teacer of game programming courses.

And many more things...

Currently in practice of the art of over engineering at MOOC-Center, University of Helsinki.

Feel free to poke around, but beware of the occasional bugs and smells.

> I don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
