## Software developer developing software
I am a software developer. I develop software.

> Can you make my app?

I could, but I probably won't.

I have been making my computer do things for me since 2011. I pick up new skills every time I either need to or want to.
In addition to creating software, I have also taught others how to develop software, specifically how games are programmed and what parts game engines contain.

Currently practicing the art of overengineering at the MOOC-Center, University of Helsinki.

Here you can find some of my public garbage. I don't weed my GitHub garden, nor do I use artificial gardening techniques, so I'm actually not sorry if it's not as green as you'd hope.
Some of my work is and has been outside of GitHub.
